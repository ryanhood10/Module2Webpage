# Module2Webpage- Ryan's Landing Page

This is a landing page for potential employee, Ryan. The Navbar at the top can be used to jump down to the coorisponding areas of the webpage. In "Links" you can click the hyperlinks to take you to external webpages. Down in the "Portfolio" section, you can click on the images to take you to that specific projects page. The live link is not available for project number 2, for now it is redirected to google. This webpage is responsive and should adjust with your screen, as well as be compatible on all devices.
